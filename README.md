This is the curriculum design of the C programming language.
a simple data management system, but not completed, it's only to exercise using gnu-make,
vim, git, gdb, etc.
it uses linked list to store data scanned from file. Due to lack of consideration, it only used
singly linked list, which cause a problem adding delete or sort functions(doubly linked list should
be better).
Also, file arrangement is not reasonable, which makes it difficult to modify functions, so I think
it's time to put an end to it, for it's enough for the purpose(after all it's my first project).
